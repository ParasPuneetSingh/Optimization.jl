# Optimization.jl: A Unified Optimization Package

Optimization.jl provides the easiest way to create an optimization problem and solve it.
It enables rapid prototyping and experimentation with minimal syntax overhead by providing
a uniform interface to >25 optimization libraries, hence 100+ optimization solvers
encompassing almost all classes of optimization algorithms such as global, mixed-integer,
non-convex, second-order local, constrained, etc. It allows you to choose an
Automatic Differentiation (AD) backend by simply passing an argument to indicate
the package to use and automatically generates the efficient derivatives of the
objective and constraints while giving you the flexibility to switch between
different AD engines as per your problem. Additionally, Optimization.jl takes
care of passing problem specific information to solvers that can leverage it
such as the sparsity pattern of the hessian or constraint jacobian and the expression graph.

It extends the common SciML interface making it very easy to use for anyone
familiar with the SciML ecosystem. It is also very easy to extend to new
solvers and new problem types. The package is actively maintained and new
features are added regularly.

## Installation

Assuming that you already have Julia correctly installed, it suffices to import
Optimization.jl in the standard way:

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("Optimization")
```

The packages relevant to the core functionality of Optimization.jl will be imported
accordingly and, in most cases, you do not have to worry about the manual
installation of dependencies. [Optimization.jl](@ref) natively offers a LBFGS solver
but for more solver choices (discussed below in Optimization Packages), you will need
to add the specific wrapper packages.
